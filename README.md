# Alien-Students-Tableau-Dashboard
Tableau Visualisation of Alien Students in the USA. This dashboard talks about the origin, academic level, major and source of fund for the Alien Students from 2007 - 2023

**Introduction:** 

My viz aims to look at **Over-population** and **Lack** of **Post-study completion** jobs amongst _**International Students**_ by dissecting which international origins are over populating and which majors are popular and which ones are declining since 2007 and the probable reason for the same

Also, the viz analyses how these students obtain their funding which plays an important role in decision making for students as well as for universities to bridge gaps in their funding programs.

**Data/operation abstraction design:**

I found 5 datasets in Kaggle that were not meant to be joined, as they didn't have any major primary and foreign key, so I had to individually analyse the data in each dataset and create a viz individually

There were many attributes in each category that I chose to remove from the viz as they made the analysis complicated and it wasn't adding any depth to the viz.








**Future work:**

**Find relevant datasets and analyse the trends:**
1. How **easily they found jobs** - no. of months/ years to get a full-time / contract job
2. **Time taken** to get **ROI** (Return on Investment) for the funds spent in education
3. The effect of Relevant **Experience** - quantity/quality, **College type**, **Major type**, **Origin of Student** on:
   **Job roles
   Salaries
   ROI
   Job satisfaction**
